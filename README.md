# Adventure-Remake
This is a small project to remake [Adventure (1980 video game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(1980_video_game)) with a twist. The main twist would be getting a bow instead of the *dragon-slaying sword* and this changing the game's orthographic view to a 3rd person over-the-shoulder style. This will probably involve adding new levels and mechanics for this new perspective.
