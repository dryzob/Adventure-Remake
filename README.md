# Adventure-Remake
 Game files for a remake of _Adventure_ in Godot

 The basic concept was recreating the classic game _Adventure_ with a small twist. This is going to involve recreating both variations of the map in blender (or any 3D software, blender was just the one I have a small experience with) to allow for a over-the-shoulder camera. There will probably be new enemies added but that might be scope-creep.
